## Pong in **SFML**

An implementation of the game Pong in SFML using C++.<br>

- This is my first completed project in C++.<br>
- This is my first time using SFML.<br>
- This is my first time writing Makefiles.<br>
**So I apologise if the code is not the best! I'm still learning :D**<br>

<br>

### To play

#### _Prerequisites_
You must have **SFML** and the **gcc compiler**<br>
On Arch, simply run `pacman -S sfml gcc`<br>
Other Linux distro's should have similar packages in their repositories.<br>

#### _Building_
To build the project, clone in into a directory, and run `make`<br>

#### _Playing_
To play, just execute the generated file, with `./out`<br>
- **Player 1** uses the **W** and **S** keys.<br>
- **Player 2** uses the **Up Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys.<br>

Thanks for playing!
